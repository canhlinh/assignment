Go is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed at Google by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. Go is syntactically similar to C, but with memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing, and CSP-style concurrency. The language is often referred to as "Golang" because of its domain name, golang.org, but the proper name is Go.

There are two major implementations:

Google's self-hosting compiler toolchain targeting multiple operating systems, mobile devices, and WebAssembly.
gccgo, a GCC frontend.
A third-party transpiler GopherJS compiles Go to JavaScript for front-end web development.
